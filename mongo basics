-------

---> MongoDB has the capacity to store massive amounts of data.
     Manipulation of datas stored here are easier and faster.
     
---> MongoDB vs MySQL:
          MONGO DB:     Collections    Documents
          MY SQL:       Tables         Table-data
          
---> JSON is a kind of structure to store datas. 
     These dats are stored in the form of key value pairs.
     These dats when gets stored inside the DB, gets converted into BSON data. Binary form. Which makes it even more easier to handle the data.
