MongoDB:
-------

---> MongoDB has the capacity to store massive amounts of data.
     Manipulation of datas stored here are easier and faster.
     
---> MongoDB vs MySQL:
          MONGO DB:     Collections    Documents
          MY SQL:       Tables         Table-data
          
---> JSON is a kind of structure to store datas. 
     These datas are stored in the form of key value pairs.
     These datas when gets stored inside the DB, gets converted into BSON data. Binary form. Which makes it even more easier to handle the data.
     
---> Why MongoDB over MySQL?
     --> The dynamic nature of MongoDB schema is useful because most of the data that is being generated by internet applications and IoT devices are non-structured
         which cannot be saved in a traditional SQL database. 
     --> Additionally, many companies will store data before they know how it will be used later.
     --> In MySQL, for every set of datas, tables have to be created, and linked to each other.
     --> In MongoDB, datas are stored in JSON format which doesnot require a proper structure. 
     --> It is often faster to retrieve a single document from MongoDB than to JOIN data across multiple tables in MySQL.
